# Introduction #

As well as indexing documents in this reference application a new feature that will be added is named entity recognition using GATE ANNIE.  Named Entity recognition or extraction is the process of creating meta data from unstructured text.  For example the process may involve identifying people, organisations, legal entities from text documents.  This is a powerful feature which fits well with this reference project.
